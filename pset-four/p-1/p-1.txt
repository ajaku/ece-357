UNIX: Linux on Ubuntu based WSL x86, Kernel version is ??

1a) When you press Control-Backslash terminal quits and generates a core dump.
The signal is called SIGQUIT, and it sends it to the process that is currently
running and quits it, generating a core dump containing relevant memory sections,
and registers which when combined with GDB can reconstruct the call stack.

1b) To rebind CTRL + C (default for SIGINT) on Ubuntu, it is possible to utilize
the stty command. By typing stty -a, you can see current settings. You edit
SIGINT, you type stty -intr [character combination], in this case stty -intr ^U

1c) The code prints out:
Having a nice day, so far
Got a signal 11
Where signal 11 pertains to a segmentation fault (SIGSEGV)
What is happening here is that a SIGSEV fault is sent when attempting to 
dereference a pointer that does not exist yet, causing the signal handler
to be called. When that happens, the handler function is called, yet within
the handler another segmentation fault occurs for attempting to perform a 
similar operation. Thus, the handler won't return back to the main function 
because it encountered an error while executing. Should the segmentation fault
not occur within the handler we would instead get stuck within an infinite loop.
