2a:
	- Due to the file descriptor of the write command being 1, the program will write
	out 3 bytes ("XYZ") into standard output, resulting in no error.
2b:
	- Open will attempt to either create or truncate to a file called oopsy within the root
	directory. However, without elevated permissions the command can't do so.
2c:
	- Will read 3 bytes of the file per iteration of the loop, printing out  3 (3 times) and
	1 (once) then, the offset of the read will be past the end of the file, resulting in bytes
	being read and 0 getting consecutively printed.
2d:
	- Attempting to write the NULL value to standard output results in the Bad Address
	error, which upon further inspection is the EFAULT error. Thus, this command is attempting
	to write out the value of a void pointer pointing to "null" which doesn't "exist" within
	memory, causing a fault.
2e:
	- The close function takes in a filedescriptor, and any value less than 0 results
	in the EBADF error which specifies that the function did not recieve a valid
	file descriptor.
