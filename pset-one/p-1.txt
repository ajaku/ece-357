1a: 
	- fgetc itself is not a system call and is performed in user mode. However, it would use the
	 read system call as well as the open system call to open the file.
1b: 
	- Depends on the type of function. Given that the previous question was true, fgetc is technically
	both a function which results in systemcall that requires elevated permissions. Seeing as to how 
	functions can incorporate other functions, systemcalls are considered to be functions in c.
1c: 
	- Requires a system call because it will use sbrk or mmap.
1d: 
	- Requires a system call, specifically will use gettimeofday of time.
1e: 
	- User mode.
