Can the following be accomplished in user mode or require a system call?
1a) reading one char from a file on disk using fgetc
	- Depends on the location of the file?
1b) calling a function
	- Depends on the type of function. Given that the previous question was true, fgetc is technically 
	both a function and a systemcall that requires elevated permissions.
1c) struct whack *s = malloc(sizeof *s);
	- User mode
1d) getting current time of day
	- User mode
1e) double e = exp(1.0);
	- User mode
