How the shell works:
Two modes: ./shell input_script # Runs commands within script (1)
           ./shell # Takes user input (2)

- Ignore # signs (comments)
- Tokenize input (take note of seperating redirection tokens)
- Fork to create the process
	Child:
	- Establish I/O redirection.
	- exec the command
	Parent:
	- Call a version of wait and wait for child to complete
	- Report information about command that was completed
	- Keep track of exit status
	- Report errors between steps but don't quit. Only quit at the EOF token.
