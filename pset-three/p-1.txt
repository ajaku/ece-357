1.1: Full Pathname of Binary (which child of pid 123 execs) is /bin/sh

1.2: argc = 3, argv = ["f2.c", "f3.c", "f4.c"]

1.3: Assuming the fork properly ran, the child process would get destoryed, and the
parent process would be return back from its PPID state to PID state, waiting for
the next command to come in.

1.4 To report the exit status of the child, the parent utilizes a systemcall called 
wait(&status) which updates status to provide information about the life of a child.
The value of the status can be expanded by using macros descirbed within the 
man pages for wait. WIFEEXITED(status) followed by WIFEEXISTATUS(status) (if previous
was true) would tell us the exit status of the child. The last 8 bits would be 0 if 
exited normally and a seperate signal if not. In this case, since foobar does not 
exist within the location specified for the command to be ran, the status would be 
non-zero.
